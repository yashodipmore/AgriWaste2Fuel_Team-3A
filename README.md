# AgriWaste2Fuel ‚Äì Turning Agricultural Waste into Green Energy

**Annam.Ai Hackathon-Based Internship Project ‚Äì Group 3A**  
> An initiative under the Annam.AI Hackathon 2025

---

## Project Overview

**AgriWaste2Fuel** is an AI-powered web application that helps farmers and rural communities convert their agricultural waste into useful resources like **compost** or **biogas**, while estimating **GHG savings**, calculating **carbon credits**, and generating a **certificate of impact**.

This project is built as part of the **Annam.AI Hackathon**, which aims to solve real-world problems in the agri-tech and sustainability domains using AI and open-source technology.

---

##  Problem Statement

> **Domain:** Agriculture & Environment  
> **Challenge:** Efficient farm waste management with environmental benefit tracking.

We aim to build a **smart waste converter** that:
- Detects & classifies farm waste.
- Recommends biogas or compost processing.
- Estimates GHG emissions saved.
- Converts those savings into potential carbon credits.

## System Architecture

![System Architecture](docs/Architecture.png)

We follow a modular, scalable architecture:

1. **User Layer**: Farmer uploads an image or manually enters waste type.
2. **Frontend**: React app with intuitive UI to upload, view results, and download certificate.
3. **API Gateway**: FastAPI backend manages all logic, data routing, and model calls.
4. **Processing Layer**:
   - YOLOv8 model classifies waste from image
   - NLP classifies manually entered waste
   - Recommendation engine suggests Compost or Biogas
   - GHG calculator estimates CO‚ÇÇe saved
   - Credit estimator returns carbon credits + ‚Çπ value
   - PDF generator creates certificate
5. **Database Layer**:
   - Firebase: User auth (optional), upload logs
   - PostgreSQL: Emission factors, waste types, credit rates
6. **Output**: JSON response + certificate download link
7. **Deployment**:
   - Frontend: Vercel
   - Backend: Render
   - Model: TorchServe / Flask API

## System Modules

### 1. **Farm Waste Detection & Classification**
- Image-based detection (YOLOv8)
- Manual keyword input (NLP/regex)
- Waste quantity estimation

### 2. **Biogas or Compost Recommendation**
- Decision tree logic based on type & quantity
- Output: suggested method, steps, tools, expected result

### 3. **GHG Savings Prediction**
- Use weight and standard emission factors
- Calculate savings using:  
  `GHG Saved = weight √ó (EF_burning ‚àí EF_conversion)`

### 4. **Carbon Credit Estimation**
- 1 ton CO‚ÇÇe saved = 1 credit
- Multiply by market rate
- Optional: generate digital certificate
